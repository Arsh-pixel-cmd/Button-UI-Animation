## 📂 Project Structure

Blob-Button/
│
├── index.html # HTML structure with button and SVG filter
├── style.css # CSS styling and animations

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The `index.html` includes a button with nested spans.
2. The blob animation is powered by a `SVG <filter>` with `feGaussianBlur` and `feColorMatrix`.
3. On hover:
   - Blob spans animate upward and scale up.
   - Button text color transitions smoothly.
   - Blobs merge fluidly due to the `goo` filter.
